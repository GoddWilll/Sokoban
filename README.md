# sokoban
This is a Sokoban written in Java for our first year at University of Mons.
The game might have broken textures, the code needs to be fixed.
I'll explain more about how the game works and how you can use it the proper way when the time comes.
I can't do it right now, but someday :)
# requirements
You need to have Java and ffmpeg installed on your computer.
The game is mainly made for Windows users, you may have some trouble with Linux.
